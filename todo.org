      Hey Sergey! As discussed earlier I am sending a short blurb about my areas of interest and
      skill that you may want to use as reference when reaching out to Martin and Binoy. Also I wanted to
      thank you for all your help as I go through the rather daunting task of applying.
      
      On paper the things that I work on are as follows:
      - Filtering malicious deserializations with taint tracking (W.I.P.)
      - Permutation theory analysis of World War II cryptography (W.I.P.)
      - Large scale video game reverse engineering and modification
        - Skyrim Together (see https://skyrim-together.com/)
        - Hogwarp (see https://hogwarp.com/)
      - Fast algorithms for enumerating orbits of representations on vector spaces
        - A Census of Cubic Fourfolds over F_2 (see https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/0000-000-00/S0025-5718-2024-04010-3/)
      - Generalizing support vector machines to aribtrary Remannian manifolds (W.I.P.)

      I have a strong background in binary reverse engineering and pure mathematics so I generally lean towards
      intersections of these two fields. I am a fan of the standardization and canonicalization of computer
      science curricula and theory -- perhaps with a tinge of bias from my math background. I am primarly seeking
      an advisor who is interested in a cross-disciplinary and generalized approach to security research. I am a self-motivated
      researcher with many projects I hope to get under way in my doctorate. As such, I am looking for an advisor who allows for a component of freedom
      in research but can provide strong guidance.

      You asked in our meeting about my Stallman/Torvalds-esque take on how I can make the world a better place. I'll give my best attempt at
      answering after some thought on our conversation. I like to imagine what ideas would look like upon "rediscovery". If a theory
      disappeared tomorrow, what would it look like in its recreation and reimplementation? Would we make the same choices and
      formalizations, or were such things only created out of the context of their time? I find that on reanalyzing old or "completed" ideas, that is,
      ideas that were stored in a box somewhere as a tool us computer scientists use, there is often more to be uncovered.

      A concrete example may be more illuminating. When I first learned about SVMs I was taught that we have achieved an "optimum". Lagrangian
      optimization meant that we could find ideal solutions for the problem at hand and thus there was no need to further question
      the tools we use to implement such machines. Apparently scikit-learn and various libraries are sufficient to abstract that idea so far
      that the mechanics are irrelevant. Now all that matters is tuning parameters and representing data. However, when I began examining the historical
      progress of SVMs, I found that there were capabilitiDes of SVMs trained with gradient descent that weren't offered by this "optimal" solution.
      Now I am attempting to contribute to a tool that is often considered unnecessary to iterate upon.

      In my view, this recipe of sifting through progress prior to its peak is the way to battle stagnation of ideas by imagining
      what these ideas would look like were we not outright told the solution.

    #+BEGIN_SRC
	Hello [NAME],

	The time has come. I am applying for PhD programs.
	For this reason I am writing to you with two purposes in mind.
	First, I was wondering if we could meet to discuss options for graduate programs that fit my
	skills and interests.
	Second, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider being one of the references in my application.
	If you would be willing I will touch base with more information as to how each school is
	requesting its references and what would be ideal to highlight.

	Best,
	Jonah Weinbaum
