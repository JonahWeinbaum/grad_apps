    Hello [NAME],

    The time has come. I am applying for PhD programs.
    For this reason I am writing to you with two purposes in mind.
    First, I was wondering if we could meet to discuss options for graduate programs that fit my
    skills and interests.
    Second, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider being one of the references in my application.
    If you would be willing I will touch base with more information as to how each school is
    requesting its references and what would be ideal to highlight.

    Best,
    Jonah Weinbaum

	Ben said not to work in this group. Engin is cool but his
