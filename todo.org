    Hello [NAME],

    The time has come. I am applying for PhD programs.
    For this reason I am writing to you with two purposes in mind.
    First, I was wondering if we could meet to discuss options for graduate programs that fit my
    skills and interests.
    Second, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider being one of the references in my application.
    If you would be willing I will touch base with more information as to how each school is
    requesting its references and what would be ideal to highlight.

    Best,
    Jonah Weinbaum
