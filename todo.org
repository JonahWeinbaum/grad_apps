Hello [NAME],

The time has come. I am applying for PhD programs. For this reason I am writing to you with two purposes in mind.
First, I was wondering if we could meet to discuss options for graduate programs that fit my skills and interests.
Second, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider being one of the references in my application.
If you would be willing I will touch base with more information as to how each school is requesting its references and what would be ideal to highlight.

Best,
Jonah Weinbaum
